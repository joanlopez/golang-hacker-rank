### Data Structures
#### Linear
The initial idea of this data structures' implementation was an interfaces-based approach. 
These implies that we can have different implementations (i.e. single & doubly linked list) of same data structures (queue, stack...). 
Another option could be a composition-based approach, for example, defining a queue data structure composed by a single linked list. 
However, IMHO, this second approach can produce data structures' usages that rely on the implementation, which is worse for me. 
Anyway, this repository was thought just to learn, so I'll be pleased to see you opening an issue and proposing improvements.
