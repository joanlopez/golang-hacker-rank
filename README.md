### HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains some solutions I've submitted to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).

When I created this repository, my main idea was the possibility of having a well-organized solutions for lookups or reusages.

Furthermore, I started learning some theory about data structures and algorithms at the same time I was learning Golang, so I wanted to improve both.

Feel free to contribute proposing improvements and opening discussions as issues.

##### Notes

Those problems that expects printing something to the standard output are not tested yet. A possible approach is a SoC (separation of concerns), making possible to test those functions responsibles of the output generation (strings?).
